			KNOWN BUGS

We apologize for the rough edges on this software.  The initial release
was somewhat rushed by the sudden death of cia.vc in late Sptember 2012;
a replacement needed to be fielded immediately.

* irkbot.py does the default UDP send correctly, but something is not
  quite right with the TCP-send code.

* irkbot.py is intended to be a multi-VCS hook script that self-configures
  from its environment, but it presently supports only git.
