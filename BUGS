			KNOWN BUGS

* Despite what the header comment implies, the URL prefix and message template
  in irkerhook.py can at present only be modified by hacking the script.

* DoS attacks on irker instances are not presently very difficult.
  Some mechanism for reaping old connections when near exhaustion of
  thread instances or file descriptors would be a good idea.
