	irker - submission tool for IRC notifications

irker is a specialized IRC client that runs as a daemon, allowing 
other programs to ship IRC notifications by sending JSON objects to a 
listening socket. 

It is meant to be used by hook scripts in version- control
repositories, allowing them to send commit notifications to project
IRC channels.  A hook script supporting git and Subversion
is included.

See the install.txt file for installation instructions.

There's an alpha-stage proxy that takes CIA XML-RPC notofications 
and passes them to a local irker instance. Find it here:

Due to the abrupt death of cia.vc in late September 2012 the
inmitial release of this software was a bit rushed.  See the file
BUGS for known problems.
