	irker - submission tool for IRC notifications

irker is a specialized IRC client that runs as a daemon, allowing 
other programs to ship IRC notifications by sending JSON objects to a 
listening socket. It is meant to be used by hook scripts in version-
control repositories, allowing them to send commit notifications
to project IRC channels.  Hook scripts are included.
