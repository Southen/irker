	irker - submission tools for IRC notifications

irkerd is a specialized IRC client that runs as a daemon, allowing 
other programs to ship IRC notifications by sending JSON objects to a 
listening socket. 

It is meant to be used by hook scripts in version-control
repositories, allowing them to send commit notifications to project
IRC channels.  A hook script, irkerhook.py, supporting git and
Subversion is included in the distribution; see the install.txt file
for installation instructions.

There's an alpha-stage proxy that takes CIA XML-RPC notifications 
and passes them to a local irker instance. Find it here:

Due to the abrupt death of cia.vc on September 24 2012 the
initial release of this software was a bit rushed.  See the file
BUGS for known problems.

Please read the file hacking.txt before modifying this code.
