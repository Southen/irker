= Forge installation instructions =

irker and irkerhook.py are intended to be installed on forge sites
such as SourceForge, GitHub, Gitorious, Gna, and Savannah.  This
file explains the theory of operation, how to install the code,
and how to test it.

== Installing irker installation ==

irker needs to run constantly, watching for TCP and UDP traffic on
port 6659.  Install it accordingly.

You should *not* make irker visible from outside the site firewall, as
it can be used to spam IRC channels while masking the source address.

== Installing irkerhook.py ==

irkerhook.py should be called from the post-commit hook of each 
repository.  See its header comment for detailed installation 
instructions.

You should set the server and either repository or project variables
from the command line in your post-commit hook.  The server variable
should be set to the inside-the-firewall host running your irker
instance.

A git invocation line should look something like this:

/usr/local/bin/irkerhook.py project=foobar server=internal.foobar.net

A Subversion invocation should look something like this:

REPOSITORY=$1
REV=$2
irkerhook.py repository=$REPOSITORY commit=$REV server=internal.foobar.net

Note that the basename of the repository will be used as the project
name. 

== Testing ==

Go to a project repo and call
